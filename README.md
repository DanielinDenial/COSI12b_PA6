# K-Means Clustering Algorithm

k-means clustering is a method of vector quantization that aims to partition n observations into k clusters in which each observation belongs to the cluster with the nearest mean (cluster points), serving as a prototype of the cluster. It is popular for cluster analysis in data mining.
